Requirements
============
You'll need Ruby 1.9.3 and a terminal that supports colors.


Playing
=======
Navigate to the directory in your terminal and run

	` ruby ./game `

without quotes. If you're a seasoned Ruby user, you may have a different
command for running Ruby files. Also, Linux/OS X users may simply

	` chmod +x ./game `
	` ./game `

This will give the file permission to be run, and the second command runs the
file. 


Controls
========
y	-	Northwest
u	-	Northeast
h	-	West
j	-	North
k	-	South
l	-	East
b	-	Southwest
n	-	Southeast
>	-	Down stairs
<	-	Up stairs
U 	-	Use item, follow up with the key in your inventory
g	- 	Pick up item
.	-	Wait a turn


Tips
====
When you level up your unarmed damage and health go up. Try to avoid insurance
salesmen at early levels. They're pretty mean.

Good luck!
