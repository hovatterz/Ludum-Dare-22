About
=====
Your friend has ventured into a cave without you and is lost and alone! It is
up to you to save him! Battle through hordes of 90s boy band members, people
who work in predatory industries, and other horrors of the deep!

Don't read any of the source files if you care about spoilers. This includes 
the ./game file that runs the game.


Requirements
============
You'll need Ruby 1.9.3 and a terminal that supports colors.


Playing
=======
Navigate to the directory in your terminal and run

	` ruby ./game `

without quotes. If you're a seasoned Ruby user, you may have a different
command for running Ruby files. Also, Linux/OS X users may simply

	` chmod +x ./game `
	` ./game `

This will give the file permission to be run, and the second command runs the
file. 


Controls
========
y	-	Northwest
u	-	Northeast
h	-	West
j	-	North
k	-	South
l	-	East
b	-	Southwest
n	-	Southeast
>	-	Down stairs
<	-	Up stairs
U 	-	Use item, follow up with the key in your inventory
g	- 	Pick up item
.	-	Wait a turn


Tips
====
When you level up your unarmed damage and health go up. Try to avoid insurance
salesmen at early levels. They're pretty mean.

Good luck!
